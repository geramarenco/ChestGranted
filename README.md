## Instalation

1. You need a Riot API key, go to [Riot portal](https://developer.riotgames.com/) and login with your league of legends credentials and generate the API key

2. Download the [lastest](https://github.com/geramarenco/ChestGranted/releases/download/v0.0.1/ChestGranted.v0.0.1.rar) version
3. Unrar
4. Paste your API key on the first line of RiotApi.txt file
5. Run

You need to generate your own API key because riot doesn't give me a real token yet. When he does, I'll update all things to improve the app.
